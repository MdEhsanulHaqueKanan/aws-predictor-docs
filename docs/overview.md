# AWS Serverless YouTube Popularity Predictor

This project is a complete, end-to-end Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) pipeline built on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It trains a model to predict the potential view count of a YouTube video and deploys it as a scalable, cost-effective, serverless API with an interactive web frontend.

The entire architecture is designed to run with **zero ongoing monthly costs**, leveraging the AWS "Always Free" Tier.

## üèÜ Key Achievements

This project showcases a full range of modern MLOps skills, from automated cloud-based builds to a fully serverless, user-facing application.

- **Cost-Effective Architecture:** Engineered the entire prediction service and frontend to operate on the **AWS Always Free Tier**, resulting in **$0/month ongoing costs.**
- **CI/CD for Machine Learning:** Implemented a complete CI/CD pipeline using **AWS CodeBuild** and **GitHub**.
- **Serverless First:** Deployed the model as a highly-available, auto-scaling serverless function using **AWS Lambda** and **API Gateway**.
- **Static Site Hosting:** Deployed a responsive frontend as a static website using **AWS S3**.
- **Containerized Training:** Orchestrated model training as a one-off, containerized batch job on **AWS ECS Fargate**.
